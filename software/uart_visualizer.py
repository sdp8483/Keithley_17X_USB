"""This is a simple application written in Python and TKinter.

The application's main purpose is not to serve a specific one. This is a generic application
for sending and receiving data from the computer to UART host controller (Arduino).

The major functions are self update and get data which are threaded to make sure the GUI does not freeze.
The GUI runs in the main thread, the worker threads are the two separate ones.

A simple Arduino Test Sketch is also made to test the purpose of this app which sends data in a specific 
format. 

Format: 
    String outgoing_data = {"1,2,3,4,5"};

The array size has been limited to 5 since the UNO has 5 analogue Sources and the progress bars 
represent the 5 bars.
